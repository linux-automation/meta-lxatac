Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: arm: stm32: Add compatible string for Linux
 Automation LXA TAC
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add DT compatible string for Linux Automation GmbH Test Automation
Controllers (LXA TAC).
LXA TACs are a development tool for embedded devices with a focus on
embedded Linux devices.

As of now there are two STM32MP157 based hardware generations (Gen 1 and
Gen 2) that have most of their hardware config in common.
In the future there will also be a STM32MP153 based hardware generation.
